# ShedWM

Custom tiling window manager based on TinyWM.

About
-----
ShedWM is a small, personal tiling window manager I built from TinyWM as a base. It's intentionally minimal and focused on being small, fast, and easy to tweak for my own workflows. This repository is my working copy and is tailored to my preferences — it's not yet polished for general distribution, but it should look presentable if others take a peek.

What it does
-----------
- Implements a compact tiling window management core derived from TinyWM.
- Provides basic window operations such as focusing, moving, and closing windows.
- Offers simple keyboard-driven controls to manage windows without a mouse.
- Keeps the feature set intentionally small so the code stays easy to read and modify.

Status
------
This project is in active, early-stage development. I haven't written installation or packaging instructions yet — I want to finish some core features and cleanup before documenting how to install or configure it.

Development notes
-----------------
- Primary language: C (most code is in C; minimal Makefile support is included).
- Design goals: minimal dependencies, lightweight runtime, and easy-to-understand source for tinkering.
- If you explore the source, expect code that is arranged for quick experimentation rather than production hardening.

License
-------
No formal license is specified in this repository (see LICENSE if one is added).

(README intentionally omits installation instructions — will add those once development stabilizes.)
